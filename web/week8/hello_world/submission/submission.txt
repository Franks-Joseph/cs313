	Everything is working correctly. But I do not like how I was suppose to make it work. 

2. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

	I guess the coolest thing was being able to use node.js to make webpages. 

3. Describe anything you did to go above and beyond with this assignment.

	I was going to put the hello world in an index.ejs file since we are going to be using express.js. The index.js file was suppose to work with the index.ejs file as 'res.render('index.ejs'); and then put the code in there but I wasted a lot of time trying to make it work under your conditions in the instructions.

5. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

	I was going to incorporate an index.ejs but I couldn't. So I did the JSON stuff with where if you add '/info' in the url. you get to see JSON data in the html. I spent more time on this than I should have. Sorry for the snarky rant but I am just a little frustrated.
