3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I really feel like the code is 95% there. I don't think that I have any large chunks missing. I think that there is a really little thing that it causing problems. Other than that, the program should work correctly.
